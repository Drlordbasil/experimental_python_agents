# LLM-Powered Function Library

A collection of Python functions that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace traditional programming functions and libraries. The goal is to create a library where every operation is handled by LLM responses rather than hardcoded functions.

## Current Functions

### Math Function
- Handles mathematical operations through LLM responses
- Replaces traditional calculator/math libraries
- Pure numerical output

### String Function
- Performs string manipulations via LLM
- Operations: reverse, capitalize, count_words, remove_punctuation
- Replaces Python's built-in string methods

### Code Function
- Generates, optimizes, and refactors code using LLM
- Operations: optimize, add_typing, add_tests, document
- Replaces traditional code generation/refactoring tools

### Embedding Function
- Generates text embeddings using LLM
- Vector representations for text analysis
- Replaces traditional embedding libraries

### Web Function
- Generates HTML/CSS components from descriptions
- Validates accessibility and structure
- Replaces template engines and component libraries

## Philosophy
The core concept is to replace traditional, static functions with dynamic LLM-powered alternatives. Instead of using pre-written functions, we let the LLM generate the appropriate response for each operation.

## Future Improvements
- Replace logging with LLM-based logging function
- Create LLM-based validation and error handling
- Develop LLM-powered configuration management
- Replace BeautifulSoup validation with LLM-based HTML validation

## Requirements
- Ollama running locally
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI library (for API structure)
- BeautifulSoup4 (temporary, will be replaced with LLM validation)
